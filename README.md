I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective


My journey in computer science has led me to develop a strong interest in cybersecurity and cloud security. I have hands-on experience working with cloud environments, security monitoring, and identifying security risks caused by misconfigurations.

I have worked with AWS and Azure, focusing on access control, network security, logging, and threat detection. Through practical labs and projects, I have investigated security alerts, identified exposed data, and helped reduce security risks by applying best security practices.
